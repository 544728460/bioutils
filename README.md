## sql_gui

A GTK2 interface to query SQLite3/PostgreSQL database.

## taxonomy

Parse and load NCBI taxonomy into a local SQLite3 database.

**Note:** NCBI taxonomy in available at [NCBI ftp](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/)

## tree

Operation on phylogenetic trees.

* reduce_trees.pl   Reduce the trees number of a BEAST analysis result.

## virdb

Parse GenBank format viral genome file (usually downloaded from GenBank) and load into an SQLite3 database.

@2017-07-04: Added new scripts, fmt_gbf.py and upd_ga_info.py, to load GISAID sequences into the database.
The work flow is:
1. Download nucleotide sequences from GISAID in FASTA formata. Keep the sequence header format is "DNA Accession no. | Isolate name | Type | Collection date".
2. Anntate GISAID nucleotide sequences by [NCBI Influenza Virus Sequence Annotation Tool](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/Database/annotation.cgi). Download the reports, in '.gbf' format.
3. Run script, fmt_gbf.py, to format the '.gbf' file into '.gbk' file.
4. Load re-formatted '.gbk' file into target database.
5. Load GISAID strain information (in a '.csv' file) into the database by script 'upd_ga_info.py'.
